# Cultist Simulator mods by KatTheFox

This repository stores my simpler JSON-only "content mods" for cultist simulator. More complex mods generated from TypeScript, such as Hawthorn, and DLL mods, such as The Wheel, have their own repositories, but are linked here for convenience.

This repository contains:
- [Secret Histories Ink](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862645619): Adds a Secret Histories pigment, so you can paint the Teresa and Christopher painting without console
- [Looping Recruitment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984715875): Simple mod to let you automatically search for acquaintances and patrons until the decks are empty. Start looping by putting 2 lore fragments in the talk verb, and if you need to stop put a health into the slot.
- [Improved Skintwisters](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2861329357): Makes Skintwisters have a 90% chance to destroy evidence, the same as every other Exalt's success chance at their job, instead of 70%, the same as a disciple. Made to replace an old mod that was less balanced.
- [Looping Mansus](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853225641): Loop your trips to the mansus. Inspired by the Looping Job mod. The Peacock's Door can only be looped with the Frangiclave, since it breaks mirrors, and the Spider's Door cannot be looped at all, as it consumes its offerings.
- [On Matthias and the Amethyst Imago: Loss](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858101668): Adds a loss sigil to the cover of On Matthias and the Amethyst Imago: Loss. Joke mod.


My other Cultist Simulator mods stored elsewhere:
- [Hawthorn](https://github.com/KatTheFox/hawthorn/) ([also on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857401350)): An attempt at a comprehensive Shelves mod, adds shelves for many popular mods as well as my take on shelves for the base game.
- [A Tewwibwe Cuwse](https://github.com/KatTheFox/tewwiblecuwse) ([also on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990679375)): AKA the uwu mod evewyone hates. Uwuifies aww text in the game, incwuding mods.
- [The Wheel](https://github.com/KatTheFox/The-Wheel) ([also on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913462842)): The most up-to-date time control mod available. Change the game speed between x0.2 and x34, customizable keybinds to skip forward through time until the next event completion, and more.


My Book of Hours mods:
- [The Wheel](https://github.com/KatTheFox/TheWheelBoH): Port of The Wheel to Book of Hours. Not in active development due to PC troubles, may or may not break when the game updates.
- [HistoryBuilder](https://github.com/KatTheFox/HistoryBuilder): A framework for crafting custom Origins for Book of Hours. Has support for both 2-numen and 3-numen Origins. Shouldn't break with game updates, but I make no guarantees.
